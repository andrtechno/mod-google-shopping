#### Either run

```
php composer require --prefer-dist panix/mod-google-shopping "*"
```

or add

```
"panix/mod-google-shopping": "*"
```

to the require section of your `composer.json` file.

#### Add to web config.
```
'modules' => [
    'shop' => ['class' => 'panix\mod\google\shopping\Module'],
],
```

#### Migrate
```
php yii migrate --migrationPath=vendor/panix/mod-google-shopping/migrations
```
```




1. Add the component configuration in your `main.php` config file:
   ```php
   'components' => [
       'ga' => [
           'class' => 'panix\mod\google\shopping\components\MeasurementProtocol',
           'tracking_id' => 'UA-XXXX-Y', // Put your real tracking ID here

           // These parameters are optional:
           'use_ssl' => true, // If you’d like to use a secure connection to Google servers
           'override_ip' => false, // By default, IP is overridden by the user’s one, but you can disable this
           'anonymize_ip' => true, // If you want to anonymize the sender’s IP address
           'async_mode' => true, // Enables the asynchronous mode (see below)
           'autoset_client_id' => true, // Try to set ClientId automatically from the “_ga” cookie (disabled by default)
       ],
   ],
   ```

Thats all!
